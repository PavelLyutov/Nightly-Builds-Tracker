# Nightly-Builds-Tracker

Spring Boot/Thymeleaf project
Helping Automation Developers to track multiple builds(jobs) in Jenkins
You can add by the user interface, different job urls and they will be saved in a propertie with the number of lastBuilds you want to track. 
Jenkins url can be added only directly through the jenkins.properties (different for every company/projects)
The app is created with a maximum of 10 builds that can
be added to track. When they are corectly added you will be able to see the last builds , their status (Running,Success,Failure) 
also direct link to their full console and allure(if they
have one), their parameters. Also functionallity to see a statistics transformed into a pie charts for the numbers of the builds you have defined earlier.

Project was created in my free time as hobby to help track my work as QA Dev and my team mates in Seeburger. Not the best quality code,
but it was fun to do and also big exercise for new skills(back end and front end).
